							<h1 class="major">Power BI - Customer Churn Analysis - Finance Domain</h1>

							<p>One of many projects that I enjoyed working on is to build Power BI reports and dashboards using simulated data from Commonwealth Bank Australia to analyze the customer churn rate.</p>

							<br>
							<p>
								To begin, I developed a  Business Requirement Document (BRD) that identified key aspects crucial to the success of the project. The BRD encompassed the following components:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>
									  <strong>Data Dictionary:</strong> A comprehensive data dictionary was created to provide a clear understanding of the dataset. This included detailed descriptions of each data field, its source, and any relevant transformations or calculations applied. The data dictionary served as a reference guide for stakeholders to better comprehend the data and ensure consistent interpretation across the project.
									</li>
									<li>
									  <strong>Data Gathering:</strong> A thorough analysis of different data assets was conducted to identify the necessary data sources for the customer churn analysis. This involved understanding the data availability, quality, and relevance to the project objectives. By examining various data repositories and systems within the organization, I ensured that all relevant data points were considered for a comprehensive analysis.
									</li>
									<li>
									  <strong>Churn Analysis:</strong> An in-depth churn analysis was performed to define the scope of the project and establish the specific objectives of the customer churn analysis. This involved studying historical customer data, identifying churn indicators, and determining the appropriate metrics and thresholds to measure churn. The analysis helped to outline the specific business questions to be answered and guided the subsequent data modeling and visualization processes.
									</li>
								  </ul>
								
							<p>
								The BRD served as a crucial foundation for the project, outlining the necessary data assets, providing clarity on data definitions, and defining the scope and objectives of the customer churn analysis. By including a data dictionary, conducting thorough data gathering, and performing a comprehensive churn analysis, the BRD ensured that all project stakeholders had a shared understanding of the data, goals, and desired outcomes.

							<p>
								<strong>Using Power BI</strong>, I effectively <strong>gathered and cleaned data, performed data transformations, and created data models to visualize key insights</strong> through professional reports. To ensure data security, I implemented <strong>row-level security measures</strong> to restrict stakeholder access to relevant information based on their respective regions. The reports were published to the Power BI service, and a centralized <strong>Power BI dashboard</strong> was created for easy monitoring.
							  </p>
							  
							<p>
								To maintain data accuracy and timeliness, I established a <strong>gateway and scheduled data refreshes for the dataset</strong>, ensuring that stakeholders had access to the most up-to-date information. Throughout the project, my thought process was evident in the meticulous creation of the business requirement document and the careful selection of report visuals to highlight key findings.

							<br>							  
							  
							<p>
								In summary, this project demonstrated my proficiency in creating business requirement documents, utilizing Power BI for data visualization and analysis, and showcasing my understanding of the finance industry and customer relationship management. The project highlighted my ability to identify and interpret crucial insights, such as the highest exit customers occurring in November and the positive correlation between exit customers and total previous month exit customers.
								<br>
								<br>
								Overall, this project exemplifies my expertise in business requirement analysis and data visualization. It showcases my ability to gather and analyze complex data sets, derive meaningful insights, and effectively communicate findings to stakeholders. These transferable skills make me a valuable candidate for a Business Analyst or Data Analyst role, where my ability to drive data-informed strategies and optimize business processes can contribute to the success of the organization.

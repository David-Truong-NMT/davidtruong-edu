							<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
							<p><strong>The Managing Medical Waste project (Rebill)</strong> aims to address the environmental and cost challenges associated with handling covid-related waste in healthcare businesses. The lack of incentives for sorting and recycling covid waste leads to its improper disposal, causing harm to the environment and increased waste management costs for businesses. To tackle this issue, we propose the implementation of "Re-Bill," a government incentive platform that encourages businesses to sort and recycle covid waste while providing them with incentives and access to free covid waste management services. By utilizing datasets from purchase invoices, Re-Bill will track medical equipment related to covid usage and develop efficient waste management plans for healthcare facilities.</p>

							<h1>Project Goals</h1>
							<p>When it comes to covid waste management, the two main words that come to mind that are considered practical and instant solutions to deal with managing covid waste are: <strong>“Sorting”</strong> and <strong>“Recycling”</strong>.</p>
							<p>While these methods may seem straightforward, implementing them is no simple task.</p>
							<p>For health sector businesses, with no incentives in sorting out covid waste from general waste, disposable clinical waste ends up in landfill with other general waste, and these medical wastes such as masks, plastic gloves, PPE clothes… can take years, if not centuries, to decompose. This represents a detrimental effect on the environment and it has a serious impact on communities that are near poorly managed landfills.</p>
							<p>For businesses that are conscious of covid waste and its effect, they do not have many options to deal with such waste. Private companies charge an expensive waste management fee for covid-related waste. In addition, by not segregating, the covid waste ends up in general waste and therefore increases the overall cost of waste management for the business because their general waste bins get filled much quicker. Healthcare facilities are inadequately equipped to manage their current waste burdens, let alone the extra COVID-19 load. Health professionals may be exposed to harmful microbes, burns, and needle stick injuries as a result of this.</p>
							<p>For those reasons,  we identify the two important goals that we need to achieve:</p>

							<ol><strong>
								<li>Encourage the sorting and recycling of covid waste the moment they are disposed, not after waste collection.</li>
								<li>Track and predict medical equipment related to covid usage and develop a waste management plan accordingly.</li>
							</strong></ol>
							<p>The real underlying questions that are hindered in these two goals are:</p>
							<ol><strong>
							<li>How are we going to encourage businesses to take initiatives in sorting out covid waste so that it reduces the cost and environmental effect of handling covid waste later on down the track?</li>
							<li>How can we accurately predict the use of covid-related equipment and plan out waste management responses?</li>
							</strong></ol>
							<p>The current lack of incentives for sorting and recycling covid waste results in improper disposal and increased waste management costs. Additionally, healthcare facilities are inadequately equipped to handle the growing covid waste load, posing risks to health professionals and the surrounding communities.</p>

							<h1>Product Solution - Re-Bill</h1>
							<p>Introducing Re-Bill, a platform for businesses to submit invoices of covid purchases to receive incentives from the government while gaining access to free covid waste management service. Re-Bill enables better sorting practice and encourages recycling of medical waste by utilizing existing datasets that every company has - their <strong>purchase invoices.</strong></p>
							<p>Re-Bill is an innovative platform that incentivizes businesses to sort and recycle covid waste. The key features of Re-Bill are as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Submit Invoices for Incentives:</strong> Businesses can submit their covid-related purchase invoices through Re-Bill to receive incentives from the government.</li>
								<li><strong>Access Free Waste Management Service:</strong> In return for submitting invoices, businesses gain access to free covid waste management services, including specialized waste bins and collection services.</li>
								<li><strong>Efficient Waste Segregation:</strong> Re-Bill encourages businesses to use designated waste bins (e.g., Purple bins) for covid-related medical waste, promoting efficient waste segregation.</li>
								<li><strong>Tracking and Planning:</strong> Re-Bill utilizes purchase invoices to track covid equipment usage, enabling the government to develop effective waste management plans based on data from individual businesses.</li>
							</ul>

							<h1>Product Benefits</h1>
							<ul>

By encouraging businesses to segregate and recycle covid-related medical waste, they avoid potential penalties and legal issues associated with improper waste disposal.</li>
								<li><strong>Reputation and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong> Adopting Re-Bill demonstrates a business's commitment to environmental sustainability and CSR. Businesses can showcase their responsible waste management practices to customers, investors, and stakeholders, enhancing their reputation and social impact.</li>
								<li><strong>Data-Driven Insights:</strong> The platform's utilization of purchase invoice data provides valuable insights into covid equipment usage trends. The government and healthcare businesses can use this data to identify patterns, plan for future needs, and optimize waste management strategies.</li>
								<li><strong>Improved Staff Safety:</strong> By using designated waste bins for covid waste disposal, businesses minimize the risk of accidental exposure to harmful materials for their staff members. This leads to a safer working environment and reduces the likelihood of health professionals experiencing injuries and infections.</li>
								<li><strong>Collaborative Approach:</strong> Re-Bill fosters collaboration between the government and healthcare businesses to address the challenge of medical waste management collectively. By sharing responsibilities and incentives, the platform creates a unified effort towards sustainable waste handling.</li>
								<li><strong>Scalable and Adaptable Solution:</strong> Re-Bill's technology-driven approach allows for scalability and adaptation to cater to varying business sizes and types.

From regulatory compliance and staff safety to positive environmental impact and data-driven insights, the platform serves as a holistic solution for efficient and responsible medical waste management. Embracing Re-Bill not only empowers healthcare businesses to take a proactive approach to waste handling but also contributes to a sustainable and healthier future for all.</p>
							
							<h1>Pricing Model</h1>

							<p>Re-Bill charges its customers based on a percentage of the government incentives provided for submitting covid-related purchase invoices through the platform. For every $1000 worth of covid-related purchases submitted, businesses will receive a pro-rata voucher for free waste management services. Re-Bill's revenue will be generated by retaining a small percentage of this government incentive as its service fee. The remaining amount will be utilized to cover the cost of providing free waste management services and support the platform's sustainability.</p>

							<p><strong>Benefits of the Pricing Model</strong></p>

							<ul>
								<li><strong>Transparent and Incentivizing:</strong> Re-Bill's pricing model ensures complete transparency, as businesses will clearly see the portion of the government incentive retained as the platform's service fee. Additionally, the incentive-based structure provides a strong incentive for businesses to actively participate in proper sorting and recycling practices.</li>
								<li><strong>Win-Win-Win Situation:</strong> The pricing model creates a win-win-win situation for businesses, the government, and the environment. Businesses receive financial incentives in the form of vouchers, effectively reducing their waste management costs while maintaining their commitment to responsible waste disposal. The government achieves its goal of promoting sustainable waste management practices, and the environment benefits from reduced landfill waste and increased recycling rates.</li>
							</ul>

							<h1>Financial Projection</h1>

							<p>Re-Bill's unique revenue generation model is projected to bring in substantial income for the platform. With an estimated 100 healthcare businesses on board within the first year, Re-Bill is expected to generate a revenue of $500,000. This revenue will be derived from the government incentives provided to businesses for submitting their covid-related purchase invoices through the platform.</p>

							<p>One of the primary goals of Re-Bill is to reduce waste management costs for healthcare businesses. By encouraging proper sorting and recycling of covid waste at the point of disposal, the platform is projected to increase the sorting and recycling rate by a significant 40%. As a result, businesses can expect to achieve a remarkable 25% reduction in waste management costs. This translates to considerable cost savings for each participating healthcare facility, improving their bottom line.</p>

							<p>Re-Bill promises a swift return on investment for businesses. With the reduction in waste management costs and the revenue generated through government incentives, the initial investment in implementing and training on the Re-Bill platform is expected to be recovered within a short payback period of just six months. This rapid payback period ensures that businesses can quickly start benefiting from the financial advantages of Re-Bill, further incentivizing them to participate in the platform.</p>

							<p>The financial projections for Re-Bill indicate its potential for scalability and growth.

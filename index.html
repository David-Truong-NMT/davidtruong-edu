						<h2>About me</h2>
						With 3+ years of experience working in various consulting and leadership roles, I have always worked directly with business owners, senior managers, and executives to evaluate performance and recommend best practices based on business insights. I am also an entrepreneur with a business in Freight Forwarding Service. Business decisions I made are based on clear and actionable insights derived from the business data. I have experience identifying issues and strategizing solutions to help businesses run efficiently and improve on brand strategies, digital marketing automation, financial operations and customer relationship management.
						<br>
						<br>
						I am also currently spearheading various service improvement projects focused on enhancing the future student journey at the University of Tasmania in my role as Team Leader at Future Student Services - part of the Student Services and Operation Division.</br>
						<br>
						<p>Let's explore a few of the key skills I can bring to the table:</p>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-people-line"></span>
								<h3>Leadership Skill</h3>
								<p>I have experience managing my own logistics business with 4 staff, and I used to run my restaurant business with over 5 employees. Currently, I am a Team Leader at UTAS' Future Students Office, overseeing a team of 13 staff. 
									<br>
									<br>This highlights my leadership skills, ability to train and onboard new staff, manage expectations and performance KPIs, foster a positive team environment, and serve as a motivating team player.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-diagram-project"></span>
								<h3>Project Management</h3>
								<p>I possess strong project management skills, characterized by my ability to effectively plan, organize, and execute projects from start to finish. Most of my previous work experiences involve service improvement and customer conversion projects, which included redeploying systems, build training programs, refining internal work processes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Two of the most recent projects that I led include the creation of an onboarding training package using Articulate software (1 month completion before schedule) and the coordination to establish an escalation pathway between the University of Tasmania and the Australian Maritime College (AMC). Furthermore, I took the initiative to introduce the use of UTAS Oracle CRM platform to AMC staff, thereby establishing a more consistent communication channel between the two institutions.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-user-check"></span>
								<h3>User Acceptance Testing</h3>
								<p>Users are at the center of the implementation of any new system or software, and my expertise in User Acceptance Testing (UAT) allows me to ensure their needs and expectations are met. I have a strong ability to design comprehensive test scenarios and execute test cases effectively, ensuring that all aspects of the system are thoroughly tested. 
									<br>
									<br>The most recent projects involves a review of UTAS Oracle CRM system, Student Pulse API Application, exploratory testing of Student Mangagement 2023A version, creating and conducting UAT review of Google Appsheet for operational control center of my freight  business Hudo Express. </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-magnifying-glass-chart"></span>
								<h3>Analytics and Business Softwares Proficiency</h3>
								<p>I have experience working with a range of softwares, including Data Analysis tools (SQL, Python, Power BI), Web development application suit (HTML, CSS and Javascript), Enterprise Architecture and Systems (Oracle and SAP), accounting software (Xero) and Business Management suit and Project Management software (Trello, Asana, and Office 365 suit).
								<br>
								<br>
								I recently led the work of integrating PowerAutomate and ChatGPT to automate the process of capturing key updates for Future Student Service team and convert these key updates into a weekly newsletter. This automated workflow, powered by PowerAutomate to capture key updates from MS Teams and Generative AI to craft informative newsletters, represent a valuable and time-effective solution for both team members and the leadership team.
								<br>
								<br>As a technology-driven professional, I am committed to continuously enhancing my skills and staying updated with the latest advancements. Leveraging my quick learning ability and dedication to learning, I strive to optimize the use of latest tools and technologies to deliver more efficient and impactful results.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-user-tie"></span>
								<h3>StakeHolder Management</h3>
								<p>Stakeholder management is a critical skill that I possess and prioritize in my work. I understand the importance of effectively communicating and collaborating with stakeholders to ensure alignment, engagement, and successful project outcomes. 
								<br>
								<br>I have honed my stakeholder management skills through various experiences, including engaging with team members, cross-functional teams, executive leadership, clients, suppliers and business partners. 
								<br>
								In my currently leader role at the University, that would be communicating with Data Analytics team to retrieve applicants and future students' data, discuss budget with the Director of the division, work with leadership team from Marketing, Admission, Curriculum Managers and College Hub Managers to coordiante service and run conversion campaigns to attract future students. 

								In my business, it is about dealing directly with clients, logistics partners, suppliers, air cargo agents, Australian and Vietnamese Customs.  </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-chart-pie"></span>
								<h3>Data Visualisation and Reporting</h3>
								<p>I have good data analysis skills, including data extraction, data cleaning, and the ability to visualize data to present key information to relevant stakeholders. As a team leader in the Future Students Office, I regularly analyze the number of students progressing through the pipeline (Application-Offer-Acceptance-Enrolment) and evaluate the team's efficiency. For instance, at the end of every semester, I thoroughly examine the data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. This analysis helps me make data-driven decisions to enhance the team's performance and develop strategies for continuous improvement in the following semester.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-sitemap"></span>
								<h3>Business Process Modelling and Improvement</h3>
								<p>Throughout my experience, I have successfully used modeling techniques, such as BPMN or UML and intelligent diagramming program, such as Lucidchart, to create clear and structured visual representations of processes that help stakeholders understand and evaluate their efficiency, identify process bottlenecks, recommend improvements, and facilitate streamlined workflows.
									<br>
									<br>With a keen eye for detail and a systematic approach, I have the ability to map out the various steps, interactions, and dependencies within a process, thus identify opportunities for improvements.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-bullseye"></span>
								<h3>Strategic Thinking and Planning</h3>
								<p>As a business owner, I have honed my strategic thinking and planning skills by consistently considering the long-term sustainability and growth of my business. This has involved analyzing market trends, identifying opportunities, and developing comprehensive plans to achieve objectives, ranging from immediate objectives like a 1-month to a quarter sales plan, all the way to a year-long, overarching strategic scheme. In my role as a team leader at UTAS, I understand the importance of aligning short-term projects with the overarching strategic plan of the Student Services division. This requires evaluating the impact of each project on the overall goals and ensuring that our efforts contribute to the long-term success of the University. 
									<br>
									<br>By taking a strategic approach in both my business ownership and leadership roles, I have demonstrated my ability to think critically, anticipate future needs, and make informed decisions with a long-term view.</p>

									<h2>Optimizing Efficiency - Harnessing the Power of established technology and the latest AI tech</h2>
									<p>In the pursuit of optimizing efficiency, I embarked on a journey to harness the power of both established technology and the latest AI innovations. My first stride involved the creation of a comprehensive library of standard text and hotkeys within the university Oracle CRM system. Concurrently, I ventured into AI tech by developing an AI chatbot using Zapier interface, which seamlessly connected with OpenAI, transformed into a virtual email assistant for our team. Together, these endeavors not only bolstered our productivity but also paved the way for more personalized interactions with students, ensuring that every communication was both efficient and meaningful.

In GovHack 2022, my team won the highest International division prize by showcasing the best utilization of open government data to build a proof of concept solution. Within a span of less than 72 hours, we efficiently identified the key problem, crafted a compelling business case, created a data-driven narrative, and developed a minimum viable product (MVP) for our solution.</p>

							<h2>Get in touch</h2>
							<p>A few more interesting things about me. I love to play competitive strategy board games. I love watching inspiring business movies (The Founder - starring Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc is my absolute favorite). 
								<br>
								<br>I enjoy learning. Continuous learning is an understatement of who I am. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about a new skill, exploring a new application, leveraging innovative AI solutions to enhance operational efficiency, delving into business and data analysis, or uncovering intriguing trends in the business world, or more pertinent to my current focus, delving into news regarding regulatory shifts and compliance updates within the industry I'm working in.
								<br>
								<br>On top of graduating with a Masters in Data Intelligence from University of Tasmania (UTAS), I also run a small logistics business and currently work as the Team Leader in the Future Students Office at UTAS. My work mainly revolves around identifying barriers in the service and conversion process and proactively work on projects to build a more intelligent customer experience.

							<h1 class="major">Deliver Systems and Processes trainings - Create onboarding material using Articulate 360</h1>
			
							<p>The Future Students Service team regularly interacts with numerous applications and software systems, including the Student Management (SM) system, Service Desk Utility, and application portals for international and domestic students. While training sessions for these systems were previously conducted on an ad-hoc basis, there has consistently been a lack of comprehensive guidelines and instructions for effectively utilizing these software applications to assist with student inquiries.</p>

							<p>One common issue that illustrates this challenge is the integration problem, which has resulted in new students being unable to enroll through the eStudent platform. With my strong technical problem-solving skills, I promptly began to decipher how these software systems interacted with each other and disseminated my understanding to the team via the use of UML flowchart diagram as shown below.</p>

							<p><strong>Instructional flowchart and training - Example of Troubleshooting Integration Issue Flowchart</strong></p>

							<p>Recognizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of the various systems at UTAS, such as how to address integration issues between different UTAS portals, I took a proactive approach to bridge this knowledge gap within our team.</p>

							<p>To achieve this, I spearheaded the creation of a detailed and easy-to-follow flowchart. This visual representation served as a step-by-step troubleshooting guide, outlining the precise actions to be taken at each stage and clearly identifying the appropriate points for escalation. By collaborating with subject matter experts and technical teams, I ensured that the flowchart covered all potential scenarios and provided foolproof solutions to common integration challenges.</p>

							<br>
							
							<p>Once the flowchart was meticulously crafted, I initiated a comprehensive training program for my team and extended it to other teams across the division. During these training sessions, I not only presented the flowchart but also conducted interactive workshops, allowing team members to actively engage with the troubleshooting process. By participating in these workshops, my team members gained practical experience in handling integration issues and became more confident in applying the solutions presented in the flowchart.</p>

							<p>The introduction of flowcharts like the above and the accompanying training had a transformative impact on our team's understanding and approach to handling different complex UTAS systems and software. By shifting from an isolated troubleshooting approach to a more cohesive and standardized system, we witnessed a remarkable improvement in our efficiency and problem-solving capabilities. Team members were now equipped with a comprehensive reference tool that guided them through complex integration challenges.</p>

							<p><strong>Onboarding Training Program Using Articulate 360</strong></p>

							<p>As the team leader of the Student Services team, I identified the crucial requirement for a comprehensive and captivating onboarding training program. It became evident that such a program would not only facilitate a seamless transition for new team members but also serve as a valuable training refresher for our current staff. Emphasizing the significance of this initiative, I firmly believe it is the long-term solution to address the most substantial underlying challenge of knowledge retention and enhance our team's understanding and job satisfaction.</p>

							<p>Leveraging my expertise in instructional design and my IT background, I embarked on a project to create an onboarding training program using Articulate 360, specifically Rise 360 and Storyline. The goal was to provide a virtual classroom experience that would equip new staff members with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in their roles and provide exceptional service to future students.</p>
							
							<span class="image" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

							<br>

							<p>During off-peak periods, I dedicated time to building an onboarding training program for the Future Student Services team using Articulate 360. This platform allowed me to create a "classroom" experience that made the onboarding process exciting, memorable, and practical for new staff members. The program was designed based on extensive research of the student lifecycle, identifying the main phases and the corresponding processes that future students go through (Enquiry - Application - Acceptance - Enrolment). Business objectives were incorporated into each stage, ensuring a seamless facilitation of students throughout their journey.</p>

							<p>The development of the onboarding training program involved utilizing various elicitation methods such as interviews, document analysis, simulated environment, requirements workshops, use cases, and scenarios. This enabled me to understand the pain points of both staff members and students as end-users, ensuring that the training addressed their needs effectively. Multiple iterations of the training were tested and refined based on feedback before being officially deployed in September 2023.</p>

							<br>

							<p>The implementation of the onboarding training program using Articulate 360 yielded significant results and showcased my strengths and abilities. The program's success can be measured by the following outcomes:</p>

							<ul>
							<li><strong>Engaging Onboarding Experience:</strong> The Articulate 360 training program provided new staff members with an immersive and interactive learning experience. This resulted in faster knowledge acquisition, increased retention, and enhanced practical application of skills.</li>
							
							<li><strong>Seamless Facilitation of Students:</strong> The onboarding training program empowered staff members to effectively facilitate students throughout their journey. The training program equipped staff members with the necessary skills to provide exceptional service and support at every single stage of Future Student Journey at UTAS.</li>
							
							<li><strong>More efficient staff onboarding:</strong> Previously, onboarding used to be a lengthy 3-month process, and new staff members would face a steep learning curve with trial and error. Mistakes were common before they grasped the right processes and systems for facilitating students at UTAS. (I was once in their shoes.) However, after implementing the Articulate 360 onboarding training program, the onboarding time has significantly shortened to less than 1 month. New staff members now have a clear understanding of business objectives at each stage of the student journey and are equipped with the necessary tools and resources to excel in assisting students. Additionally, our current staff utilizes Articulate training to refresh their knowledge on complex systems and work processes. As our team expands its knowledge base, I continue to use Articulate software to build new training modules.</li>
							</ul>

							<br>

							<p>Interestingly, the foundational structure of this program found its origins in my personal Notion notes during my initial days as a team member in the Future Students Service. Back then, I soon recognized the imperative need for a comprehensive training initiative tailored to the unique demands of our team.
							<br>
							<br>
							To guide students seamlessly through the enrolment process, our team had to transcend traditional knowledge of university course offerings. We needed to become adept in understanding the intricate inner workings of various UTAS systems and teams, their intricate interactions, and how to efficiently and effectively troubleshoot issues that prospective students might encounter as they  start their journey at UTAS. Achieving a balance between quality and quantity in a high-performing team like Future Students was contingent on our members possessing a robust understanding of the university's operational landscape.
							</p>

							<p>During my initial months, I harnessed Notion software to meticulously craft the layout and content for an onboarding training and knowledge hub that I believed would greatly benefit new team members. My efforts garnered recognition and support from the division's manager, eventually evolving into a comprehensive Articulate onboarding module. This module has now been officially integrated into the division's training resources, cementing its place as an invaluable asset.
							</p>

							<p>The successful implementation of the onboarding training program using Articulate 360 showcased my strengths and abilities in instructional design, technical expertise, and project management. By leveraging innovative technology (Articulate is probably the most innovative and best training software on the market at the moment) and utilizing various elicitation methods, I created a comprehensive and engaging training program that addressed the team's needs and facilitated a seamless onboarding experience for new staff members.</p>
